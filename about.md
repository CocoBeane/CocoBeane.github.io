## About me (the professional)

<h3><a class="resume" href="img/Charlie_Smith_Base_Resume.pdf" data-fancybox="gallery">View my Resume</a></h3>

My ability to easily adapt and pick up new skills has made me a shapeshifter in the professional world. I have been a writing tutor, TV producer, data-entry drone, freelance content writer, bakery assistant, IT support specialist, full-stack software engineer, and more.

I have a BA in Television Writing and Producing from Columbia College Chicago, but I’ve spent the last decade of my professional life in the tech industry. There are many striking similarities between these two worlds. In the tech world, my degree skills easily translate to technical writing and product management roles. These sorts of internal service jobs have often been my strongest suit – I love to make my colleague’s jobs easier by thinking up new ways to streamline processes, automating the boring stuff, and whipping up clear, concise reference documentation.

I pride myself on being a strong communicator, detail-oriented, highly organized, and self-managing. I'm interested in remote and hybrid roles located in Chicago, and am open to full-time, part-time, or contract/freelance work.

## About Me (the person)

How do you talk about yourself? Ok, how about the basics first? I'm a native Michigander who has been living in Chicago for over a decade. I use they/them pronouns. I like fries and sour gummy worms and Mexican food.

Let's jump over some of the stuff in the middle. How about some big-picture concepts I value?

**Creativity.** I am a collector of creative hobbies. I love to design and make things. I draw, sew, knit, screen print, lino print, do film photography, papier-maché weird halloween masks, super-glue stuff together to make a super-thing -- you know, handy skills. Enjoying the process is just as important and the finished product. Just like with my work, I will pick up whatever skills I need to complete a project (or do the research and determine that it would be better to bring on an expert, if I need to!)

**Adventure.** When most people think of the word adventure, they think of someone with a big, important-looking hat climbing a mountain in a very foreign country on some sort of expedition. That's not really my style; I'm in it for the small adventures. Try out a new skill. Visit an area of the city you've never been to. Fail. Succeed. I am a lifelong learner, and that comes from seeking out small adventures.

**Community.** I believe in the power of people, and the power of what we can do when they come together for the common good. Individuality is important because the power of each person only adds to the power of the collective whole. I believe in equity, diversity, self-sustaining systems, and robust public infrastructure. My bike is my main mode of transporation, and I am an avid public transit rider. I also volunteer at CHIRP Radio, Chicago's independent community-run radio station. You can check them out and stream worldwide [here](http://chirpradio.org)!

**Environment.** The term "common good" doesn't just apply to things that are good for humans. I believe we have a responsibility to the environment, as well as to others. I love seeing nature and humanity intersect in harmonious ways. On a smaller scale, I love spending time outdoors. I love the smell of wet grass. I get excited about native biodiversity, community gardening, and just seeing the seasons change.
