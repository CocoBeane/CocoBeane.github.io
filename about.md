### Hi! I'm Charlie Smith.

I live in Chicago. I use they/them pronouns.

I have a BA in Television Writing and Producing, but Iâ€™ve spent the last decade of my professional life in the tech industry. My degree skills translate easily to technical writing and project management, so I excel at internal support jobs. I pride myself on being a strong communicator, detail-oriented, highly organized, and self-managing.

As engineering support, I took pride in streamlining processes, increasing efficiency, automating the boring stuff, and creating robust documentation that empowered others to go forward confidently.

As a software developer, I created technology that grows to meet users where they are, instead of expecting them to adapt to the structures of back-end data.

As an independent artist, I'm inspired by creative reuse, the cyclical nature of time, and the places where dated analog machinery and digital technology overlap. I enjoy screen printing, digital design for physical media, and textiles.

### I'm available for hire.
