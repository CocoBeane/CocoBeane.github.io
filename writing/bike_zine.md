## About The Project
A zine is a term for a self-published mini magazine or booklet. This one was created for a digital typography and self-publishing class I took at Lillstreet Art Studio in Chicago. I continued working on it after the class ended, with the goal of eventually printing and assembling the final product to sell on consignment at local stores that have a section for self-published work.

### Audience
This zine was written with the intention of reaching a wide audience. It is primarily targeted at people who bike casually in the city of Chicago and would like to bike more, but are intimidated by the challenges they may face in doing so. However, I also wanted the zine to appeal to two other groups: those who already bike frequently in the city and are familiar with the challenges (so they couuld see how other people do things, and maybe get some new ideas) and those who don't bike in the city at all (so they could understand the challenges that bikers in the city face.)

### Considerations and Challenges
The zine format provides a huge amount of creative control, but each choice comes with its own unique challenges and considerations. Among the many things I had to keep in mind during this project, I was most focused on two things: keeping the cost down, and finishing a printable "minimum viable product"-style first draft within the time limit of the class.

I chose to make this zine in a bi-fold format, meaning each two-page spread is equivalent to one landscape-oriented sheet of standard 8.5" x 11" paper. Thus, all the information in each individual "page" needed to fit within half a sheet of standard paper (a space that comes out to quite a bit less than 4.25" x 5.5", when factoring in page margins and spacing!) Due to material costs, the class restricted the amount of paper we were allowed to use, so I had to keep each zine under 10 full sheets of paper. _Also_ in order to print correctly in a bi-fold format, the number of pages had to be divisble by four. Phew!

The information on each half-size page needed to be formatted such that it all fit without looking too cluttered, and the text was still big enough to be readable. I chose to illustrate the zine with my own line art because I wanted to -- I like drawing, and I wanted to get more experience using Adobe Illustrator. Using artwork also added visual variety and fun to the page with an engaging "infographic" feel. I chose black and white line-art specifically to cut down on cost and time. The entire zine was originally going to be black and white for the same reason, but I ended up deciding to add one color: a yellow "highlighter" effect to bring attention to some areas. It sacrificed a small amount of cost, but the zine gained a lot of visual appeal.

With no marketing or built-in distribution method, a zine has to stand out on a shelf of similar work. It must be eye-catching in order to entice the casual book store browser to first pick it up off the shelf. Then, it must be packed with information, engaging, and entertaining to encourage the reader not only to give it a quick flip, but to also determine that it requires a more thorough read and should be purchased. I hope these sample pages leave you wanting a little bit more.

### Skills Used
* Adobe InDesign for page layout, using consistent visual, type, paragraph styles across the document to keep cohesion (first time using InDesign.)
* Adobe Photoshop, for scanning and cleaning up the line-art, which I drew by hand.
* Adobe Illustrator, for turning the line-art into vector graphics and editing them (first time using Illustrator.)
* Independently studied graphic design basics, choosing typefaces.
* Learned about choosing appropriate images for the page backgrounds and textures, ensuring everything is appropriately licensed for free use or credited where necessary.
* Gathered data from online biking forums I frequent, and interviewed biking friends for their tips and equipment suggestions, so I had some variety in the information I was presenting.
* Accepted feedback from friends and classmates and incorporated it into the finished product.
