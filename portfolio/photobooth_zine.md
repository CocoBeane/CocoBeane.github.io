### About The Project
A zine is a term for a self-published mini magazine or booklet. This one was created for a digital typography and self-publishing class I took at Lillstreet Art Studio in Chicago. I continued working on it after the class ended, with the goal of eventually printing and assembling the final product to sell on consignment at local stores that have a section for self-published work.

### Audience
This zine is primarily targeted at people who bike casually in the city of Chicago, and want to find ways to work biking into their life more, but are afraid of the challenges they might run into.

### Skills Used
* Adobe InDesign for page layout, using consistent visual, type, and paragraph styles across the document to keep cohesion (first time using InDesign.)
* Adobe Photoshop, for scanning and cleaning up the line-art, which I drew by hand.
* Adobe Illustrator, for turning the line-art into vector graphics and editing them (first time using Illustrator.)
* Independently studied graphic design basics, choosing typefaces.
* Learned about choosing appropriate images for page backgrounds and textures, ensuring everything is appropriately licensed for free use or credited where necessary.
* Gathered data from online biking forums I frequent, and interviewed biking friends for their tips and equipment suggestions so I had some variety in the information I was presenting.
* Accepted feedback from friends and classmates and incorporated it into the finished product.

### Considerations and Challenges

#### The zine must be cheap to produce.
I made this zine in a bi-fold format, which means each two-page spread is equivalent to one landscape-oriented sheet of standard 8.5" x 11" paper. I designed each page with a simple, limited color palette. These choices made the zine easily printable on a home printer.

#### A printable first draft of the zine must be finished within the time limit of the class.
I originally created this zine for a five-week class. I needed to have a presentable, printable draft ready to trade with my classmates by the end of the fifth week. To keep within the deadline, I did the following:
* Made sure to limit the scope of the project to something I believed I could finish in the designated time.
* During the outlining phase, I determined must-haves, as well as various levels of stretch-goals that could be included once the must-haves were achieved. 
* Planned my production schedule meticulously, and set aside designated chunks of work time throughout the week.

#### The zine must be eye-catching and visually appealing.
All the information in each individual page of the zine needed to fit within half a sheet of standard paper (a space that comes out to quite a bit less than 4.25” x 5.5”, when factoring in page margins and spacing.) The information on each half-size page needed to be formatted such that it all fit without looking too cluttered, and the text was still big enough to be readable. I chose to illustrate the zine with my own line art because I wanted to (I like drawing, and I wanted to get more experience using Adobe Illustrator.) However, using artwork also added visual variety and fun to the page and created an engaging infographic feel.

I chose black and white line-art specifically to cut down on cost and time. The entire zine was originally going to be black and white for the same reason, but I ultimately decided to add one color (a bright yellow highlighter effect) to bring attention to some areas. It sacrificed a small amount of the cost-per-page I was saving by printing in black and white, but the zine gained a lot of visual appeal.

With no marketing or built-in distribution method, a zine has to stand out on a shelf of similar work. It must be eye-catching in order to entice the casual book store browser to first pick it up off the shelf. Then, it must be packed with information, engaging, and entertaining to encourage the reader not only to give it a quick flip, but to also determine that it requires a more thorough read and should be purchased. I hope these sample pages leave you wanting a little bit more.
